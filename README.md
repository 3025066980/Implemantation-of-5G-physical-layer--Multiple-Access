Power Allocation In NOMA


Multiple access is a technique which allows multiple user to share their data using the same allotted time-frequency resources


NOMA via Power Domain Multiplexing
In Power domain NOMA, different users are allocated different power levels depending on the Channel State Information(CSI).

In power NOMA the user with poor CSI is allocated more power as compared to another user with good CSI. This way we can ensure:-
Reduced interference by the user with good CSI as less power is allocated to it.
Improved detection accuracy for the user with poor CSI as more power is allocated to it.

CSI: refers to the known channel properties of the communication link.



Successive Interference Cancellation(SIC)
It takes place at the receiver side were we receive a superimposed signal of multiple users with different power levels.
The SIC receiver works in the descending order of signal strength.
